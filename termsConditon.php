        <h2>7. Customer Reviews</h2>
        
        <p>a. Customer reviews or ratings for Restaurants do not reflect the opinion of Zonoldelivery. 
            Zonoldelivery receives multiple reviews or ratings for Restaurants by Customers, which reflect the 
            opinions of the Customers. It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on 
            Zonoldelivery is the personal opinion of the Customer/reviewer only. Zonoldelivery is a neutral 
            platform, which solely provides a means of communication between Customers/reviewers 
            including Customers or restaurant owners/representatives with access to restaurant business 
            page. The advertisements published on the Zonoldelivery Platform are independent of the reviews 
            received by such advertisers.
        </p>
    
        <p>b. We are a neutral platform and we don't arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes 
            a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant 
            representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any 
            misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular Customer's review violates any 
            of the Zonoldelivery' policies, the restaurant may write to us at <a href="mailto:support@zonoldelivery.com">support@zonoldelivery.com</a> and 
            bring such violation to our attention. Zonoldelivery may remove the review in its sole discretion if 
            review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the 
            Services.

        <h2>XIII. Additional Terms and Conditions for Customers using the various services offered by Zonoldelivery:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>FOOD ORDERING AND DELIVERY:</h3>

                <p>
                    a. Zonoldelivery provides food ordering and delivery services by entering into contractual 
                    arrangements with restaurant partners (“Restaurant Partners”) and Stores (as defined below) on 
                    a principal-to-principal basis for the purpose of listing their menu items or the Products (as defined 
                    below) for food ordering and delivery by the Customers on the Zonoldelivery Platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    b. The Customers can access the menu items or Products listed on the Zonoldelivery Platform and 
                    place orders against the Restaurant Partner(s)/Store(s) through Zonoldelivery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    c. Your request to order food and beverages or Products from a Restaurant Partner or a Store 
                    page on the Zonoldelivery Platform shall constitute an unconditional and irrevocable 
                    authorization issued in favour of Zonoldelivery to place orders for food and beverages or Products 
                    against the Restaurant Partner(s)/Store(s) on your behalf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    d. Delivery of an order placed by you through the Zonoldelivery Platform may either be 
                    undertaken directly by the Restaurant Partner or the Store against whom you have placed an 
                    order, or facilitated by Zonoldelivery through a third-party who may be available to provide 
                    delivery services to you (“Delivery Partners”). In both these cases, Zonoldelivery is merely acting 
                    as an intermediary between you and the Delivery Partners, or you and the Restaurant Partner or 
                    the Store, as the case may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                The acceptance by a Delivery Partner of undertaking delivery of your order shall constitute a 
contract of service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or any successor legislations, 
between you and the Delivery Partner, to which Zonoldelivery is not a party under any applicable 
law. It is clarified that Zonoldelivery does not provide any delivery or logistics services and only 
enables the delivery of food and beverages or Products ordered by the Customers through the 
Zonoldelivery Platform by connecting the Customers with the Delivery Partners or the Restaurant 
Partners or the Store, as the case may be
                </p>
                <p>
                Where Zonoldelivery is facilitating delivery of an order placed by you, Zonoldelivery shall not be 
liable for any acts or omissions on part of the Delivery Partner including deficiency in service, 
wrong delivery of order, time taken to deliver the order, order package tampering, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                You may be charged a delivery fee for delivery of your order by the Delivery Partner or the 
Restaurant Partner or the Store, as the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store 
may determine (“Delivery Charges"). You agree that Zonoldelivery is authorized to collect, on 
behalf of the Restaurant Partner or the Delivery Partner or the Store, the Delivery Charges for the 
delivery service provided by the Restaurant Partner or the Store or the Delivery Partner, as the 
case may be. The Delivery Charges may vary from order to order, which may be determined on 
multiple factors which shall include but not be limited to Restaurant Partner / Store, order value, 
distance, time of the day. Zonoldelivery will inform you of the Delivery Charges that may apply to 
you, provided you will be responsible for Delivery Charges incurred for your order regardless of 
your awareness of such Delivery Charges
                </p>

                <p>
                In addition to the Delivery Charges, you may also be charged an amount towards delivery surge 
for delivery of your order facilitated by the Delivery Partner or the Restaurant Partner or the Store, 
which is determined on the basis of various factors including but not limited to distance covered, 
time taken, demand for delivery, real time analysis of traffic and weather conditions, seasonal 
peaks or such other parameters as may be determined from time to time (“Delivery Surge"). You 
agree that Zonoldelivery is authorized to collect, on behalf of the Restaurant Partner or the 
Delivery Partner or the Store, the Delivery Surge for the delivery service provided by the 
Restaurant Partner or the Store or the Delivery Partner, as the case may be. The Delivery Surge 
may vary from order to order, which may be determined on multiple factors which shall include 
but not be limited to Restaurant Partner / Store, order value, distance, demand during peak hours. 
Zonoldelivery will use reasonable efforts to inform you of the Delivery Surge that may apply to 
you, provided you will be responsible for the Delivery Surge incurred for your order regardless of 
your awareness of such Delivery Surge
                </p>


                <p>
                 In respect of the order placed by You, Zonoldelivery shall issue documents like order summary, 
tax invoices, etc. as per the applicable legal regulations and common business practices
                </p>

                <p>
                You are expected to respect the dignity and diversity of Delivery Partners and accordingly you 
agree to not discriminate against any Delivery Partner on the basis of Discrimination 
Characteristics (as defined below). You are also expected to enable provision of a secure and 
fearless gig/ platform work environment for the delivery partners including prevention and 
deterrence of harassment (including sexual harassment) towards Delivery Partners
                </p>

                <p>
                Discrimination Characteristics shall mean discrimination based on race, community, religion, 
disability, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age (insofar as permitted by applicable laws 
to undertake the relevant gig work), genetic information, or any other legally protected status.
