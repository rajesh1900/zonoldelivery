This document is published in accordance with the provisions of Rule 3 (1) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 that require publishing the rules and regulations, privacy policy, and Terms of Use for access or usage of <a href="https://www.zonoldelivery.com" target="_blank">www.zonoldelivery.com</a> website and Zonol Delivery application for mobile and handheld devices.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>These terms of use (the "Terms of Use") govern your use of our website <a href="https://www.zonoldelivery.com" target="_blank">www.zonoldelivery.com</a> (the "Website") and our "Zonol Delivery" application for mobile and handheld devices (the "App"). The Website and the App are jointly referred to as the "Platform". Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you use the services. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the services on the Platform, and we request you to uninstall the App.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>By installing, downloading, or even merely using the Platform, you shall be contracting with Zonol Delivery and signify your acceptance of this Terms of Use and other Zonol Delivery policies (including but not limited to the Cancellation & Refund Policy, Privacy Policy, and Take Down Policy) as posted on the Platform and amended from time to time. This takes effect on the date of download, installation, or use of the Platform, creating a legally binding arrangement to abide by the same.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Platform is owned and operated by Bundl Technologies Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, with its registered office at No.55, Sy No.8-14, Ground Floor, I&J Block, Embassy Tech Village, Outer Ring Road, Devarbisanahalli, Bengaluru – 560103, Karnataka, India. For the purpose of these Terms of Use, "you", "user", or "User" shall mean any natural or legal person transacting on the Platform by providing registration data while registering on the Platform as a registered user using any computer systems. The terms "Zonol Delivery", "we", "us" or "our" shall mean Bundl Technologies Private Limited.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE: PROVIDE YOUR COMPANY DETAILS ABOVE.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Zonol Delivery enables transactions on its Platform between participating restaurants/merchants and buyers, dealing in (a) prepared food and beverages, (b) consumer goods, and (c) other products and services ("Platform Services"). Buyers ("Buyer/s") can choose and place orders ("Orders") from a variety of products and services listed and offered for sale by various merchants, including but not limited to restaurants, eateries, and grocery stores ("Merchant/s"), on the Platform. Additionally, the Buyer can place Orders for undertaking certain tasks on the Platform (“Tasks”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Zonol Delivery enables the delivery of such Orders or completion of Tasks at select localities of serviceable cities across India ("Delivery Services") by connecting third-party service providers i.e., pick-up and delivery partners (“PDP”) responsible for providing pick-up and delivery services and completing Tasks initiated by the users of the Platform (Buyers or Merchants). The Platform Services and Delivery Services are collectively referred to as "Services". For both Platform Services and Delivery Services, Zonol Delivery is merely acting as an intermediary between the Merchants and Buyers and/or PDPs and Buyers/Merchants.</p>
          <p>PDPs are individual entrepreneurs engaged with Zonol Delivery on a voluntary, non-exclusive, and principal-to-principal basis to provide aforementioned services for a service fee. PDPs are independent contractors and are free to determine their timings of work. Zonol Delivery does not exercise control on the PDPs, and the relationship between the PDPs and Zonol Delivery is not that of an agent and principal or employee and employer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the pickup and delivery services and completing the Tasks, PDPs may charge the users of the Platform (Buyers or Merchants) a service fee (inclusive of applicable taxes whenever not expressly mentioned), determined on the basis of various factors including but not limited to distance covered, time taken, demand for delivery services/Tasks, real-time analysis of traffic and weather conditions, seasonal peaks, or such other parameters as may be determined from time to time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Amendments</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms of Use are subject to modifications. We reserve the right to modify or change these Terms of Use and other Zonol Delivery policies at any time by posting modified documents on the Platform and notifying you of the same for your perusal. You shall be liable to update yourself of such changes, if any, by accessing the same. You shall, at all times, be responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms of Use and the other Zonol Delivery policies and note the changes made on the Platform. Your continued usage of the Services after any change is posted constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms of Use and other Zonol Delivery policies. As long as you comply with these Terms of Use, Zonol Delivery grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to access, enter, and use the Platform. By accepting these Terms of Use, you also accept and agree to be bound by the other terms and conditions and Zonol Delivery policies (including but not limited to Cancellation & Refund Policy, Privacy Policy, and Notice and Take Down Policy) as may be posted on the Platform from time to time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Use of Platform and Services</strong></p>
          <ol start="1">
            <li>
              <p>All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Buyers and Merchants alone with respect to products and services being offered by the Merchants. The commercial/contractual terms include, without limitation, price, applicable taxes, shipping costs, payment terms, date, period, and mode of delivery, warranties related to products and services, and after-sales services related to products and services. Zonol Delivery does not have any control or does not determine or advise or in any way involve itself in the offering or acceptance of such commercial/contractual terms between Buyers and Merchants.</p>
              <p>Zonol Delivery may, however, offer support services to Merchants in respect of Order fulfillment, mode of payment, payment collection, call center support, and other ancillary services, pursuant to independent contracts executed by Zonol Delivery with the Merchants. The price of the product and services offered by the Merchant is determined by the Merchant itself, and Zonol Delivery has no role to play in such determination of price in any way whatsoever.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Upon the acceptance of any Order or Task by the PDPs, the pickup and delivery services or Task completion services (as the case may be) undertaken by him/her shall constitute a separate contract for services between Merchants/Buyers and PDPs. Zonol Delivery shall not be responsible for the services provided by PDP to Merchants/Buyers through the Platform. Zonol Delivery may, however, offer support services to PDPs in respect of Order fulfillment, payment collection, call center support, and other ancillary services, pursuant to independent contracts executed by Zonol Delivery with the PDPs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery does not make any representation or warranty as to the item-specifics (such as legal title, creditworthiness, identity, etc.) of any of the Merchants. You are advised to independently verify the bona fides of any particular Merchant that you choose to deal with on the Platform and use your best judgment on that behalf. All Merchant offers and third-party offers are subject to respective party terms and conditions. Zonol Delivery takes no responsibility for such offers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery neither makes any representation or warranty as to specifics (such as quality, value, salability, etc.) of the products or services proposed to be sold or offered to be sold or purchased on the Platform nor does it implicitly or explicitly support or endorse the sale or purchase of any products or services on the Platform. Zonol Delivery accepts no liability for any errors or omissions, whether on behalf of itself or third parties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery does not make any representation or warranty with respect to any aspect of the services being provided by the PDPs through the Platform, including but not limited to pick up and delivery services and Task completion services to the Merchants or Buyers as the case may be.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery is not responsible for any non-performance or breach of any contract entered into between Buyers and Merchants, and between Merchants/Buyers and PDP on the Platform. Zonol Delivery cannot and does not guarantee that the concerned Buyers, Merchants, and PDPs will perform any transaction concluded on the Platform. Zonol Delivery is not responsible for unsatisfactory or non-performance of services or damages or delays as a result of products which are out of stock, unavailable, or back-ordered.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery is operating an online marketplace and assumes the role of a facilitator and does not, at any point in time during any transaction between Buyer and Merchant and/or Buyer and PDP on the Platform, come into or take possession of any of the products or services offered by the Merchant or PDP. At no time shall Zonol Delivery hold any right, title, or interest over the products nor shall Zonol Delivery have any obligations or liabilities in respect of such a contract entered into between Buyer and Merchant and/or Buyer and PDP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zonol Delivery is only providing a platform for communication, and it is agreed that the contract for the sale of any of the products or services shall be a strictly bipartite contract between the Merchant and the Buyer. In the case of complaints from the Buyer pertaining to efficacy, quality, or any other such issues, Zonol Delivery shall notify the same to the Merchant and shall also redirect the Buyer to the consumer call center of the Merchant. The Merchant shall be liable for redressing Buyer complaints. In the event you raise any complaint on any Merchant accessed using our Platform, we shall assist you to the best of our abilities by providing relevant information to you, such as details of the Merchant and the specific Order to which the complaint relates, to enable satisfactory resolution of the complaint.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Similar to the above, Zonol Delivery is only providing a platform for communication with PDP and does not provide any pick-up and delivery services or Task completion services with respect to the Orders placed by Merchants/Buyers on the Platform as it is merely facilitating Delivery Services by connecting the Merchants/Buyers with the PDP through the Platform. In case of complaints by the Merchants/Buyers for deficiency or lapse in the delivery services or Task completion services provided by PDP, Zonol Delivery shall notify the same to the PDP and also assist Merchants/Buyers to the best of its abilities to enable satisfactory resolution of the complaint.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Please note that there could be risks in dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretence.</p>

    <h4>9. Order Booking and Financial Terms</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The Platform allows the Buyers to place Orders and upon acceptance of such Orders by the Merchants, Zonol Delivery will, subject to the terms and conditions set out herein, facilitate the delivery of goods or services, or completion of Tasks through PDP.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Zonol Delivery does not own, sell, resell on its own such products offered by the Merchants, and/or does not control the Merchants or the related services provided in connection thereof. Buyer understands that any Order that he/she places shall be subject to the terms and conditions set out in these Terms of Use including, but not limited to, product availability, delivery location serviceability, and acceptance of Orders by Merchants/PDPs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As a general rule, all Orders placed on the Platform and Delivery Services are treated as confirmed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>However, upon Buyer’s successful completion of booking an Order, we may call the Buyer on the telephone or mobile number provided to confirm the details of such Order, price to be paid and the estimated delivery time. For this purpose, Buyer will be required to share certain information with us, including but not limited to Buyer’s (i) first and last name (ii) mobile number; and (iii) email address. It shall be Buyer’s sole responsibility to bring any incorrect details to our attention.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In addition to the foregoing, we may also contact you by phone and / or email to inform and confirm any change in the Order, due to availability or unavailability or change in Order or change in price of any item in the Order as informed by the Merchant. Please note that any change or confirmation of the Order shall be treated as final. It is clarified that Zonol Delivery reserves the right to not to process Buyer's Order in the event Buyer or Merchant or PDP is unavailable on the phone or any other means of communication at the time when we call you for confirming the Order and such event the provisions of the Cancellation and Refund Policy shall be applicable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All payments made against the Orders or Services on the Platform by you shall be compulsorily in Indian Rupees acceptable in the Republic of India. The Platform will not facilitate transactions with respect to any other form of currency with respect to the Orders or Services made on Platform. You can pay by (i) credit card or debit card or net banking; (ii) any other RBI approved payment method at the time of booking an Order; or (iii) credit or debit card or cash at the time of delivery. You understand, accept and agree that the payment facility provided by Zonol Delivery is neither a banking nor financial service but is merely a facilitator providing an electronic, automated online electronic payment, receiving payment on delivery, collection and remittance facility for the transactions on the Platform using the existing authorized banking infrastructure and credit card payment gateway networks. Further, by providing payment facility, Zonol Delivery is neither acting as trustees nor acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the transaction or the transaction price.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Buyers acknowledge and agree that Zonol Delivery acts as the Merchant's and PDP’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from Buyers/Merchants on behalf of the Merchant or PDP, as the case may be. Upon your payment of amounts to us, which are due to the Merchant or PDP, your payment obligation to the Merchant or PDP for such amounts is completed, and we are responsible for remitting such amounts to the Merchant or PDP. You shall not, under any circumstances whatsoever, make any payment directly to the Merchant for Order bookings or to the PDP for delivery of the Order or completion of the Task made using the Platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Buyer agrees to pay for the total amount for the Order placed on the Platform. Zonol Delivery will collect the total amount in accordance with these Terms of Use and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable listing of product or restaurant service for the particular Merchant, apart from the delivery fees for Delivery Services. Please note that we cannot control any amount that may be charged to Buyer by his/her bank related to our collection of the total amount, and we disclaim all liability in this regard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In connection with Buyer’s Order, he/she will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to us or our third party payment processor. Buyer agrees to pay us for the Order placed by you on the Platform, in accordance with

 these Terms, using the methods described under clause VIII (6) above. Buyer hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by us or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Platform. If Buyer is directed to our third-party payment processor, he/she may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the Platform services. Once the Order is confirmed you will receive a confirmation email summarizing the confirmed booking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The final tax bill will be issued by the Merchant and PDP (if registered for tax purposes) to the Buyer along with the Order and Zonol Delivery is merely collecting the payment on behalf of such Merchant and PDP. All applicable taxes and levies, the rates thereof and the manner of applicability of such taxes on the bill are being charged and determined by the Merchant and PDP. Zonol Delivery holds no responsibility for the legal correctness/validity of the levy of such taxes. The sole responsibility for any legal issue arising on the taxes shall reside with the Merchant and the PDP.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The prices reflected on the Platform, including packaging or handling charges, are determined solely by the Merchant and are listed based on Merchant's information. Very rarely, prices may change at the time of placing Order due to Merchant changing the menu price without due intimation and such change of price are at the sole discretion of the Merchant attributing to various factors beyond control.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer: Prices on any product(s) as reflected on the Platform may due to some technical issue, typographical error or product information supplied by Merchant be incorrectly reflected and in such an event Merchant may cancel Buyer’s Order(s).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Merchant shall be solely responsible for any warranty/guarantee of the goods or services sold to the Buyers and in no event shall be the responsibility of Zonol Delivery.</p>
      </li>
